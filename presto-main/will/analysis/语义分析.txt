理解下面SQL具体执行过程：
select orderkey + 10, orderkey + 5 as ok from orders order by orderkey + 10, orderkey + 2, ok limit 1;

// orderkey / 100 为 complex aggregate by expression
select shippriority, count(orderkey) as cnt from orders group by clerk, shippriority, orderkey / 100 order by cnt desc, clerk, orderkey / 100 limit 1;

// 但下面的语句会报错: '(orderkey / 10)' must be an aggregate expression or appear in GROUP BY clause
select shippriority, count(orderkey) as cnt from orders group by clerk, shippriority, orderkey / 100 order by cnt desc, clerk, orderkey / 10  limit 1;

理解下下面的语句为啥报错: failed: line 1:8: Column 'orderkey' cannot be resolved
select orderkey + 10 from (select orderkey + 10, orderkey + 5 as ok from orders limit 1);

参考:
CountColumn vs CountAggregation
RealAverageAggregation as AverageAggregations


CountAggregation对应的签名: presto.default.count():bigint


CountColumn对应的签名: presto.default.count<T>(T):bigint


AverageAggregations    : select orderpriority, avg(orderkey) from orders where orderkey < 0 group by grouping sets ( (), (orderpriority));
RealAverageAggregation : select orderpriority, avg(cast(orderkey as real)) from orders where orderkey < 0 group by grouping sets ( (), (orderpriority));
